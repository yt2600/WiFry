# WiFry.img Version 0.1 Beta
this is a simple project. We have used the Kali Light version for the Rasberry 2/3 right from kali.org. We have installed the kali-linux-wireless package. And Wifijammer made by DanMcInerney (https://github.com/DanMcInerney/wifijammer), the system currently uses xfce for the window manager, it is set to auto login and auto start the wifijammer script. 

Next we plan on using a more light weight Linux distro
